# Mokshya

Mokshya is an open-source protocol and product suite that helps developers build and launch decentralized applications on multiple blockchains. Our team of developers and project managers are focused on providing well-documented smart contracts and software development kits (SDKs) to make it easier for web3 projects to get started. We are currently working on building smart contracts for Aptos, Sui, and Solana. The name Mokshya comes from Sanskrit and means liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Our aim at Mokshya is to liberate and empower developers.

Our team has launched the following smart contracts on various blockchains:

- Aptos Candy Machine **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-candymachine)**
- Aptos Token Staking **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-token-staking)**
- Aptos Pseudo Random Generator **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/pseudo-random-generator)**
- Aptos Multisig **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-multisig)**

We are committed to providing high-quality and reliable smart contracts to support the development of decentralized applications. We continue to expand our offerings and work to improve our protocols and product suite.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
