# Mokshya

Mokshya is an open-source protocol and product suite that helps developers build and launch decentralized applications on multiple blockchains. Our team of developers and project managers are focused on providing well-documented smart contracts and software development kits (SDKs) to make it easier for web3 projects to get started. We are currently working on building smart contracts for Aptos, Sui, and Solana. The name Mokshya comes from Sanskrit and means liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Our aim at Mokshya is to liberate and empower developers.

Our team has launched the following smart contracts on various blockchains:

- Aptos Candy Machine **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-candymachine)**
- Aptos Token Staking **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-token-staking)**
- Aptos Pseudo Random Generator **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/pseudo-random-generator)**
- Aptos Multisig **[(GitHub)](https://github.com/mokshyaprotocol/aptos-multisig)**

We are committed to providing high-quality and reliable smart contracts to support the development of decentralized applications. We continue to expand our offerings and work to improve our protocols and product suite.
